# Control-Therory and application

This report presents the application of control theory, particularly PID control
with feedforward, using the Temperature Control Lab (TCLab) kit. It encompasses
the design choices, experimental setup, and results, aiming to transfer the acquired
knowledge to colleagues with a foundational understanding of control theory. The
report refrains from theoretical reminders but focuses on practical implementation
and analysis.
